## My process

### Built with
- CSS Grid
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I applied what I learned in CSS Grid model. It was a bit tricky at first, especially when adding media query, because it's my first time using CSS Grid in a real world design, but it was sure fun when I achieve the layout needed for this project. 

### Continued development

My goal right now is to do and fnish all HTML & CSS project in Frondend Mentor by using everything I learned and about to learn. While doing HTML & CSS projects, I will also start learning JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This helped in learning CSS Grid. It has a tutorial in Responsive Web Design that is project based so you can practice what you learn. 
- [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia) - Watching other developers do projects enables me to learn new techniques and different ways to solve a problem.
